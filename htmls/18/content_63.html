If you or someone you know didnât attempt to sign in, remember to hit âNo, denyâ and change your password immediately to keep your account safe.</p><p><img src=\"https://secure.xfinity.com/anon.comcastonline2/support/help/faqs/HOW21321/HOW21321_110422_07.png\" alt=\"The push notification is displayed.\" data-filename=\"HOW21321_110422_07.png\" data-image-id=\"HOW21321_110422_07\" data-mce-src=\"https://secure.xfinity.com/anon.comcastonline2/support/help/faqs/HOW21321/HOW21321_110422_07.png\"><br><br></p><p>You can also verify the sign-in request within the Xfinity app if youâre currently using it or clear away the sign-in request.</p><p><img src=\"https://secure.xfinity.com/anon.comcastonline2/support/help/faqs/HOW21321/HOW21321_110422_08.png\" alt=\"The approve request button is at the bottom.\" data-filename=\"HOW21321_110422_08.png\" data-image-id=\"HOW21321_110422_08\" data-mce-src=\"https://secure.xfinity.com/anon.comcastonline2/support/help/faqs/HOW21321/HOW21321_110422_08.png\"><br><br></p><h4 id=\"mcetoc_1gh20nb092s\">Biometrics</h4><p>If your device supports biometric scanning, you can use a one-touch fingerprint ID or facial recognition as an extra layer of security.
