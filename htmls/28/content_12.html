A blog post typically covers a specific topic or query, is educational in nature, ranges from 600 to 2,000+ words, and contains other media types such as images, videos, infographics, and interactive charts.</p> <p> </p> <p> Blog posts allow you and your business to publish insights, thoughts, and stories on your website about any topic. They can help you boost brand awareness, credibility, conversions, and revenue. Most importantly, they can help you drive traffic to your website.</p> <p> But in order to begin making posts for a blog — you have to learn how to start one, first. Let’s dive in.</p> <p> </p> <h2> How to Start a Blog</h2> Understand your audience. Check out your competition. Determine what topics you'll cover. Identify your unique angle. Name your blog. Create your blog domain. Choose a CMS and set up your blog. Customize the look of your blog. Write your first blog post. <p> </p> <h3> 1. Understand your audience.</h3> <p> Before you start writing your blog post, make sure you have a clear understanding of your target audience.</p> <p> Ask questions like: What do they want to know about? What will resonate with them?</p> <p> This is where the process of creating buyer personas comes in handy. Consider what you know about your buyer personas and their interests while you're coming up with a topic for your blog post.</p> <p> For instance, if your readers are millennials looking to start a business, you probably don't need to provide them with information about getting started on social media — most of them already have that down.</p> <p> You might, however, want to give them information about how to adjust their social media approach (for example — from what may be a casual, personal approach to a more business-savvy, networking-focused approach). That kind of tweak is what helps you publish content about the topics your audience really wants and needs.</p> <p> Don't have buyer personas in place for your business? Here are a few resources to help you get started:</p> Create Buyer Personas for Your Business [Free Template] Guide: How to Create Detailed Buyer Personas for Your Business [Free Tool] Make My Persona: Buyer Persona Generator <p> </p> <span> Featured Resource</span> <h2> 6 Free Blog Post Templates</h2> <h3> Fill out the form to get started blogging. </h3> <p> </p> <h3> 2. Check out your competition.</h3> <p> What better way to draw inspiration than to look at your well-established competition?</p> <p> It’s worth taking a look at popular, highly reviewed blogs because their strategy and execution is what got them to grow in credibility. The purpose of doing this isn’t to copy these elements, but to gain better insight into what readers appreciate in a quality blog.</p> <p> There are multiple angles you should look at when doing a competitive analysis:</p> <strong> Visuals</strong> : Look at the blog’s branding, color palette, and theme. <strong> Copy</strong> : Analyze the tone and writing style of the competition to see what readers respond well to. <strong> Topics</strong> : See what subject matter their readers enjoy interacting with. <h3> 3. Determine what topics you’ll cover.</h3> <p> Before you write anything, pick a topic you’d like to write about. The topic can be pretty general to start as you find your desired niche in blogging .</p> <p> Some ways to choose topics to cover include asking yourself questions like:</p> Who do I want to write to? How well do I understand this topic? Is this topic relevant? <h3> 4. Identify your unique angle.</h3> <p> What perspective do you bring that makes you stand out from the crowd? This is key to determining the trajectory of your blog’s future and there’s many avenues to choose in the process.</p> What unique experience makes you a trusted expert or thought leader on the topic? What problem will you solve for readers? Will you share your opinions on trending debates? Teach your readers how to do something? Compare or share original research? <p> It’s up to you to decide the unique angle you’ll take on topics.</p> <h3> 5. Name your blog.</h3> <p> This is your opportunity to get creative and make a name that gives readers an idea of what to expect from your blog. Some tips on how to choose your blog name include:</p> Keep your blog name easy to say and spell. Link your blog name to your brand message. Consider what your target audience is looking for. <p> If you still need more assistance, try using a blog name generator .</p> <p> Make sure the name you come up with isn’t already taken as it could lessen your visibility and confuse readers looking for your content.</p> <h3> 6. Create your blog domain.</h3> <p> A domain is a part of the web address nomenclature someone would use to find your website or a page of your website online.</p> <p> Your blog's domain will look like this: www.yourblog.com. The name between the two periods is up to you, as long as this domain name doesn't yet exist on the internet.</p> <p> Want to create a subdomain for your blog? If you already own a cooking business at www.yourcompany.com, you might create a blog that looks like this: blog.yourcompany.com. In other words, your blog's subdomain will live in its own section of yourcompany.com.</p> <p> Some CMS platforms offer subdomains as a free service, where your blog lives on the CMS, rather than your business's website. For example, it might look like this: yourblog.contentmanagementsystem.com. However, to create a subdomain that belongs to your company website, register the subdomain with a website host .</p> <p> Most website hosting services charge very little to host an original domain — in fact, website costs can be as inexpensive as $3 per month when you commit to a 36-month term.</p> <p> <strong> Pro Tip: </strong> You can <span> connect your custom domain</span> to free hosting with HubSpot’s free CMS or in premium editions of CMS Hub. This includes access to built-in security features and a content delivery network.</p> <p> Here are five other popular web hosting services to choose from:</p> GoDaddy HostGator DreamHost Bluehost iPage <h3> 7. Choose a CMS and set up your blog.</h3> <p> A CMS (content management system) is a software application that allows users to build and maintain a website without having to code it from scratch. CMS platforms can manage domains (where you create your website) and subdomains (where you create a webpage that connects to an existing website).</p> <p> HubSpot customers host web content via CMS Hub . Another popular option is a self-hosted WordPress website on a hosting site such as WP Engine . Whether you create a domain or a subdomain to start your blog , you'll need to choose a web hosting service after you pick a CMS.</p> <p> <strong> Pro Tip: </strong> You can get started for free with HubSpot’s <span> free blog maker</span> . Our free CMS offers everything you need to get started– including hosting, a visual editor, and hundreds of free and paid themes to choose from.</p> <h3> 8. Customize the look of your blog.</h3> <p> Once you have your domain name set up, customize the appearance of your blog to reflect the theme of the content you plan on creating and your brand.</p> <p> For example, if you're writing about sustainability and the environment, green might be a color to keep in mind while designing your blog.</p> <p> </p> <p> Image Source </p> <p> If you already manage a website and are writing the first post for that existing website, ensure the article is consistent with the website in appearance and subject matter. Two ways to do this are including your:</p> Logo : This can be your business's name and logo — it will remind blog readers of who's publishing the content. (How heavily you want to brand your blog, however, is up to you.) "About" Page : You might already have an "About" blurb describing yourself or your business. Your blog's "About" section is an extension of this higher-level statement. Think of it as your blog's mission statement, which serves to support your company's goals. <h3> 9. Write your first blog post.</h3> <p> Once you have your blog set up, the only thing missing is the content. While the design and layout are fun and functionally necessary, it's the content that will draw your readers in and keep them coming back. So how do you actually go about writing one of these engaging and informational pieces?</p> <h2> Writing Your First Blog Post</h2> <p> You’ve got the technical and practical tidbits down — now it’s time to write your very first blog post. And nope, this isn’t the space to introduce yourself and your new blog (i.e. “Welcome to my blog! This is the topic I’ll be covering. Here are my social media handles. Will you please follow?”).</p> <p> Start with “low-hanging fruit,” writing about a highly specific topic that serves a small segment of your target audience.</p> <p> That seems unintuitive, right? If more people are searching for a term or a topic, that should mean more readers for you.</p> <p> But that’s not true. If you choose a general and highly searched topic that’s been covered by major competitors or more established brands, it’s unlikely that your post will rank on the first page of search engine results pages (SERPs). Give your newly born blog a chance by choosing a topic that few bloggers have written about.</p> <p> Let’s walk through this process.</p> <h3> 1. Choose a topic you’re passionate and knowledgeable about.</h3> <p> Before you write anything, pick a topic for your blog post. The topic can be pretty general to start. For example, if you're a company that sells a CRM for small-to-enterprise businesses , your post might be about the importance of using a single software to keep your marketing, sales, and service teams aligned.</p> <p> <strong> Pro tip</strong> : You may not want to jump into a "how-to" article for your first blog post.</p> <p> Why?</p> <p> Your credibility hasn’t been established yet. Before teaching others how to do something, you’ll first want to show that you’re a leader in your field and an authoritative source.</p> <p> For instance, if you're a plumber writing your first post, you won’t yet write a post titled “How to Replace the Piping System in your Bathroom.” First, you'd write about modern faucet setups, or tell a particular success story you had rescuing a faucet before it flooded a customer's house.</p> <p> Here are four other types of blog posts you could start with:</p> <strong> List ("Listicle")</strong> : 5 ways to fix a leaky faucet <strong> Curated Collection</strong> : 10 faucet and sink brands to consider today <strong> SlideShare Presentation</strong> : 5 types of faucets to replace your old one (with pictures) <strong> News Piece</strong> : New study shows X% of people don't replace their faucet frequently enough <p> If you're having trouble coming up with topic ideas, a good topic brainstorming session should help. In the post I’ve linked, my colleague walks you through a helpful process for turning one idea into many. Similar to the "leaky faucet" examples above, you would "iterate off old topics to come up with unique and compelling new topics."</p> <p> This can be done by:</p> Changing the topic scope Adjusting your time frame Choosing a new audience Taking a positive/negative approach Introducing a new format <p> And if you’re still stuck, let’s take a look at some first blog post idea examples.</p> <h4> First Blog Post Ideas</h4> <h5> The Difference Between [Niche Topic] and [Niche Topic], Explained by a [Niche Expert]</h5> The Difference Between SEM and SEO, Explained by a Marketing Expert The Difference Between Sedans and Coupes, Explained by a Car Mechanic The Difference Between Baking and Broiling, Explained by a Professional Baker <h5> The 10 Best and Worst [Niche Tools] for [Niche Activity]</h5> The 10 Best and Worst Writing Software for Fiction Writing The 10 Best and Worst CRMs for Nurturing Prospects The 10 Best and Worst Family Cars for Cross-Country Roadtrips <h5> 8 [Niche Activity] Common Mistakes (+ Ways to Fix Them)</h5> 8 Non-Fiction Writing Common Mistakes (+ Ways to Fix Them) 8 Salmon Broiling Common Mistakes (+ Ways to Fix Them) 8 Car Maintenance Common Mistakes (+ Ways to Fix Them) <h5> 9 Proven Tips for [Niche Activity]</h5> 9 Proven Tips for Checking Plumbing Problems under Your Kitchen Sink 9 Proven Tips for Writing a Non-Fiction Bestseller 9 Proven Tips for Doing DIY Car Maintenance <h5> Why We/I Switched from [Niche Tool] to [Niche Tool] (Comparison)</h5> Why We Switched from Pipedrive to HubSpot (Comparison) Why I Switched from Microsoft Word to Scrivener (Comparison) Why We Switched from iMacs to Surface Studio (Comparison) <h5> [Niche Tool] vs [Niche Tool]: Which [Tool] is Best for You?</h5> Zendesk vs Freshcaller: Which Call Software is Best for You?

See what your first blog post can look like based on the topic you choose and the audience you're targeting.</p> <h3> 2. Target a low-volume keyword to optimize around.</h3> <p> Finding a keyword with low searches in Google (we recommend sticking to about 10 to 150 monthly searches). These topics offer less competition and should therefore allow your new blog post to rank more easily.</p> <p> To choose a topic, you can either do a traditional brainstorming session or carry out keyword research. We suggest the latter because you can actually see how many people are looking for that topic.</p> <p> Now, don’t be intimidated by the term “ keyword research .” It’s not just for marketers, but for new bloggers, too. And it’s really easy to do.</p> <p> To jumpstart your keyword research, first begin by identifying the general topic of your blog.</p> <p> Say you’re a plumber. Your general, high-level topic might be “plumbing” (67K monthly searches).</p> <p> Next, put this term into a keyword research tool such as:</p> Ahrefs Moz Ubersuggest Wordtracker <p> When you run this term through the tool, a list of related keywords will appear. Scan the list and choose one with a lower search volume. For this example, we’ll use “under sink plumbing” (1.4K monthly searches).</p> <p> Run that keyword in the keyword research tool again. Look at the related keywords. Find one with a lower search volume. Do that again.</p> <p> For this example, we’ll settle on “plumbing problems under kitchen sink” (10 monthly searches). That’s the topic for our first post.</p> <p> <strong> TLDR</strong> ; Choose a low-volume, low-competition keyword that will ensure your first post ranks.</p> <p> For more help on keyword research, here are more resources you can use:</p> How to Do Keyword Research for SEO: A Beginner's Guide How to Perform Keyword Research and Rank Top Tools For Finding Long-Tail Keywords <h3> 3. Google the term to understand your audience’s search intent.</h3> <p> You’ve got your topic — now, you need to check that the user’s search intent would be fulfilled by a blog post.</p> <p> What does that mean?</p> <p> If someone is looking for “plumbing problems under a kitchen sink,” they might be looking for a tutorial, a diagram, an article, or a product that can fix the issue. If they’re looking for the first three, you’re good — that can be covered in a blog post. A product, however, is different, and your blog post won’t rank.</p> <p> How do you double-check search intent?</p> <p> Google the term and look at the results. If other articles and blog posts rank for that term, you’re good to go. If you only find product pages or listicles from major publications, then find a new topic to cover in your first post.</p> <p> Consider the term “under sink plumbing bathroom” (30 monthly searches). It seemed like a perfect fit because it had low monthly searches.</p> <p> Upon Googling the term, we found product carousels, product pages from Home Depot and Lowes, and guides written by major publications. (You’ll also want to avoid topics that have been covered by major publications, at least for now.)</p> <p> <strong> TLDR</strong> ; Before writing your first blog post about a low-volume topic, double-check the user intent by Googling the keyword. Also, don’t forget to take a look at who’s written about that topic so far. If you see a major brand, consider writing about another topic.</p> <h3> 4. Find questions and terms related to that topic.</h3> <p> You’ve got a highly unique topic that’s been covered by just a few people so far. It’s time to flesh it out by covering related or adjacent topics.</p> <p> Use the following tools:</p> Answer the Public : When you place your keyword into this tool, it will give you a list of questions related to that term. Google : Google is your best friend. Search for the term and look under “People also ask” and “People also search for.” Be sure to touch upon those topics in the post. <p> You can also use these keyword research tools we mentioned above in step one.</p> <h3> 5. Come up with a working title.</h3> <p> You might come up with a few different working titles — in other words, iterations of approaching that topic to help you focus your writing.</p> <p> For example, you may decide to narrow your topic to "Tools for Fixing Leaky Faucets" or "Common Causes of Leaky Faucets." A working title is specific and will guide your post so you can start writing.</p> <p> Let's take a real post as an example: " How to Choose a Solid Topic for Your Next Blog Post ."</p> <p> Appropriate, right? The topic, in this case, was probably "blogging." Then the working title may have been something like, "The Process for Selecting a Blog Post Topic." And the final title ended up being "How to Choose a Solid Topic for Your Next Blog Post."</p> <p> See that evolution from topic, to working title, to final title? Even though the working title may not end up being the final title (more on that in a moment), it still provides enough information so you can focus your blog post on something more specific than a generic, overwhelming topic.</p> <h3> 6. Create an outline.</h3> <p> Sometimes, blog posts can have an overwhelming amount of information — for the reader and the writer. The trick is to organize the info in a way so readers aren't intimidated by length or amount of content. This organization can take multiple forms — sections, lists, tips — whatever's most appropriate. But it must be organized!</p> <h3> Featured Resource: 6 Free Blog Post Templates </h3> <p> </p> <p> Download These Templates for Free </p> <p> Let's take a look at the post, " How to Use Snapchat: A Detailed Look Into HubSpot’s Snapchat Strategy. " There's a lot of content in the piece, so it's broken up into a few sections using descriptive headers. The major sections are separated into subsections that go into more detail, making the content easier to read.</p> <p> To complete this step, all you really need to do is outline your post. This way, before you start writing, you'll know which points you want to cover and the best order to do so. And to make things even easier, you can download and use our free blog post templates , which are pre-organized for six of the most common blogs. Just fill in the blanks!</p> <h3> 7. Write an intro (and make it captivating).</h3> <p> We've written more specifically about writing captivating introductions in the post " How to Write an Introduction ," but let's review, shall we?</p> <p> First, grab the reader's attention. If you lose the reader in the first few paragraphs — or even sentences — of the introduction, they'll stop reading (even before they've given your post a fair shake). You can do this in a number of ways: tell a story or a joke, be empathetic, or grip the reader with an interesting fact or statistic.</p> <p> Then, describe the purpose of your post and explain how it will address a problem the reader may be experiencing. This will give the reader a reason to continue reading and show them how the post will help them improve their work or lives.</p> <p> Here's an example of an intro we think does a good job of attracting a reader's attention right away:</p> <p> “Blink. Blink. Blink. It's the dreaded cursor-on-a-blank-screen experience that all writers — amateur or professional, aspiring or experienced — know and dread. And of all times for it to occur, it seems to plague us the most when trying to write an introduction.” </p> <h3> 8. Build out each section of your outline.</h3> <p> The next step — but not the last — is actually writing the content. We can't forget about that, of course.</p> <p> Now that you have your outline or template, you're ready to fill in the blanks. Use your outline as a guide and expand on all points as needed. Write about what you already know, and if necessary, conduct additional research to gather more information, examples, and data to back up your points, while providing proper attribution when incorporating external sources. When you do, always try to find accurate and compelling data to use in your post.</p> <p> If you're having trouble stringing sentences together, you're not alone. Finding your "flow" can be challenging for a lot of folks. Luckily, there are a ton of tools you can lean on to help you improve your writing.

Ways to Earn Backlinks <h2> What makes a good blog post?</h2> <p> Before you write a blog, make sure you know the answers to questions like, "Why would someone keep reading this entire blog post?" and "What makes our audience come back for more?"</p> <p> To start, a good blog post is interesting and educational. Blogs should answer questions and help readers resolve a challenge they're experiencing — and you have to do so in an interesting way.</p> <p> It's not enough just to answer someone's questions — you also have to provide actionable steps while being engaging. For instance, your introduction should hook the reader and make them want to continue reading your post. Then, use examples to keep your readers interested in what you have to say.</p> <p> Remember, a good blog post is interesting to read and provides educational content to audience members.</p> <p> (Want to learn how to apply blogging and other forms of content marketing to your business?</p> <p> Check out HubSpot Academy's free content marketing course .)</p> <h2> Quick Blog Writing Tips</h2> Conduct research if necessary to convey your point. Make your content skimmable; break it into digestible chunks. Include interesting quotes or facts for emphasis on the subject. Paint a full picture with images, graphics or video. Use Grammarly to catch mistakes. If you don’t know where to start, start by telling a story. Reference social media posts. Each sentence should convey a single idea. <p> While you have several tools and tips already, we wanted to provide you with some formatting guidelines to use before you publish your own.</p> <p> </p> <h2> Blog Format Guidelines</h2> Include H2s to arrange ideas. Center your Images. Add alt text. Keep your sentences clear and concise. Use media with purpose. <p> </p> <h3> 1. Include H2s to arrange ideas.</h3> <p> When you begin typing your blog content, it’s important that you divide paragraphs into sections that make it easier for the reader to find what they need.</p> <p> If you’re just starting out, then focus on the overarching H2s you want to talk about, and you’ll be able to branch off into subheaders and more naturally as you continue.</p> <h3> 2. Center your images.</h3> <p> This is a simple practice that can help your content look more professional with little effort. Centering your images keeps the reader’s attention drawn to the subject — not searching for elsewhere.</p> <p> Centering also looks better when translating from PC to mobile devices. As formatting transitions to small screens or windows, a centered image will remain the focal point.</p> <h3> 3. Add alt text.</h3> <p> So those images you centered earlier, make sure you have descriptive alt text for them, too.</p> <p> Image alt text allows search engines, like Google, to crawl and rank your blog post better than pages lacking the element. It also leads readers to your blog post if the keywords included are what they searched for in the first place.</p> <p> Besides SERP features, image alt text is beneficial to readers by providing more accessibility. Image alt text allows people to better visualize images when they can’t see them, and with assistive technology, can be auditorially read aloud for people to enjoy.</p> <h3> 4. Keep your sentences short and concise.</h3> <p> When you begin working on the body of your blog post, make sure readers can clearly understand what you’re trying to accomplish.</p> <p> You shouldn’t feel pressure to elongate your post with unnecessary details, and chances are that if you keep it concise, readers will derive more value from your work.</p> <h3> 5. Use media with a purpose.</h3> <p> Break up the monotony of your blog post with some multimedia content where seen fit.</p> <p> Your reader will enjoy visiting a blog page with images, videos, polls, audio or slideshows as opposed to a page of black and white text.</p> <p> It also makes it more interactive and improves your on-page search engine optimization (SEO).</p> <p> Now, do you want some real examples of blog posts? See what your first blog post can look like based on the topic you choose and the audience you're targeting.</p> <p> </p> <h2> Blog Post Examples</h2> List-Based Post Thought Leadership Post Curated Collection Post SlideShare Presentation Newsjacking Post Infographic Post How-to Post Guest Post <p> </p> <h3> 1. List-Based Blog Post</h3> <h4> List-Based Post Example: 17 Blogging Mistakes to Avoid in 2021, According to HubSpot Bloggers </h4> <p> </p> <p> List-based posts are sometimes called "listicles," a mix of the words "list" and "article." These are articles that deliver information in the form of a list. A listicle uses sub-headers to break down the blog post into individual pieces, helping readers skim and digest your content more easily.</p> <p> As you can see in the example from our blog, listicles can offer various tips and methods for solving a problem.</p> <h3> 2. Thought Leadership Post</h3> <h4> Example: How HubSpot's Customers Are Shaping the Next Normal </h4> <p> </p> <p> Thought leadership posts allow you to share your expertise on a particular subject matter and share firsthand knowledge with your readers.</p> <p> These pieces — which can be written in the first person, like the post shown above — help you build trust with your audience so people take your blog seriously as you continue to write for it.</p> <h3> 3. Curated Collection Post</h3> <h4> Example: 8 Examples of Evolution in Action </h4> <p> </p> <p> Curated collections are a special type of listicle blog post. Rather than sharing tips or methods for doing something, this type of blog post shares a list of real examples that all have something in common in order to prove a larger point.</p> <p> In the example post above, Listverse shares eight real examples of evolution in action among eight different animals — starting with the peppered moth.</p> <h3> 4. Slide Presentation</h3> <h4> Example: The HubSpot Culture Code </h4> <p> </p> <p> HubSpot Slides is a presentation tool that helps publishers package a lot of information into easily shareable slides. Think of it like a PowerPoint, but for the web. With this in mind, SlideShare blog posts help you promote your SlideShare so that it can generate a steady stream of visitors.</p> <p> Unlike blogs, slide decks don't often rank well on search engines, so they need a platform for getting their message out there to the people who are looking for it. By embedding and summarizing your SlideShare on a blog post, you can share a great deal of information and give it a chance to rank on Google at the same time.</p> <p> Need some slideshow ideas? In the example above, we turned our company's "Culture Code" into a slides presentation that anyone can look through and take lessons from, and then promoted it in a blog post.</p> <h3> 5. Newsjacking Post</h3> <h4> Example: Ivy Goes Mobile With New App for Designers </h4> <p> </p> <p> "Newsjacking" is a nickname for "hijacking" your blog to break important news related to your industry. Therefore, the newsjack post is a type of article whose sole purpose is to garner consumers' attention and, while offering them timeless professional advice, prove your blog is a trusted resource for learning about the big things that happen in your industry.</p> <p> The newsjack example above was published by Houzz, a home decor merchant and interior design resource, about a new mobile app that was launched just for interior designers. Houzz didn't launch the app, but the news of its launching is no less important to Houzz's audience.</p> <h3> 6. Infographic Post</h3> <h4> Example: The Key Benefits of Studying Online [Infographic] </h4> <p> The infographic post serves a similar purpose as the SlideShare post — the fourth example, explained above — in that it conveys information for which plain blog copy might not be the best format.</p> <p> For example, when you're looking to share a lot of statistical information (without boring or confusing your readers), building this data into a well-designed, even engaging infographic can keep your readers engaged with your content. It also helps readers remember the information long after they leave your website.</p> <h3> 7. How-to Post</h3> <h4> Example: How to Write a Blog Post: A Step-by-Step Guide</h4> <p> For this example, you need not look any further than the blog post you're reading right now! How-to guides like this one help solve a problem for your readers. They're like a cookbook for your industry, walking your audience through a project step by step to improve their literacy on the subject.</p> <p> The more posts like this you create, the more equipped your readers will be to work with you and invest in the services you offer.</p> <h3> 8. Guest Post</h3> <h4> Example: Your Bookmarkable Guide to Social Media Image Sizes in 2021 [Infographic] </h4> <p> Guest posts are a type of blog post that you can use to include other voices on your blog. For example, if you want to get an outside expert's opinion on a topic, a guest post is perfect for that.</p> <p> Additionally, these posts give your blog variety in topic and viewpoint. If your customer has a problem you can't solve, a guest post is a great solution.</p> <p> If you begin accepting guest posts, set up editorial guidelines to ensure they're up to the same standards as your posts.</p> <p> So we’ve gone through the different types of blog posts you can make, but how do you consistently make quality blog posts that your viewers will enjoy?</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <h2> How to Write a Blog Post</h2> Draw from your buyer personas and what you know about your audience. Pull from your content strategy and/or brainstormed topics. Identify what's missing from the existing discourse. Choose what type of blog post you're writing. Generate a few different titles and choose the best one. Create your outline and designate keyword-rich H2s and H3s. Write your blog post! Proofread your post. Add images and other media elements to support your ideas. Upload your post into your CMS. Determine a conversion path (what you want your audience to do next). Add calls to action to guide your audience to take action. Link to other relevant blog posts within your content. Optimize for on-page SEO. Publish and promote the blog post. Track the performance of the blog post over time. <p> </p> <h3> 1. Draw from your buyer personas and what you know about your audience.</h3> <p> Before you start writing your blog post, make sure you have a clear understanding of your target audience.</p> <p> Ask questions like: What do they want to know about? What will resonate with them?</p> <p> This is where the process of creating buyer personas comes in handy. Consider what you know about your buyer personas and their interests while you're coming up with a topic for your blog post.</p> <p> For instance, if your readers are millennials looking to start a business, you probably don't need to provide them with information about getting started in social media — most of them already have that down.</p> <p> You might, however, want to give them information about how to adjust their social media approach (for example — from what may be a casual, personal approach to a more business-savvy, networking-focused approach). That kind of tweak is what helps you publish content about the topics your audience really wants and needs.</p> <p> Don't have buyer personas in place for your business? Here are a few resources to help you get started:</p> Create Buyer Personas for Your Business [Free Template] Guide: How to Create Detailed Buyer Personas for Your Business [Free Tool] Make My Persona: Buyer Persona Generator <h3> 2. Pull from your content strategy and/or brainstormed topics.</h3> <p> If you already have a pre-existing portfolio to look back on, it would benefit you to pull from those brainstormed post ideas or previous content strategy.</p> <h3> 3. Identify what’s missing from the existing discourse.</h3> <p> Fill in the gaps of the existing discourse in the topic of your choosing.</p> <p> You want to meet a need that hasn’t already been met in your topic cluster. Otherwise, you run the risk of writing content for topics that are already over-saturated. It’s hard to beat saturated search queries when you’re trying to rank against high authority publications — but not impossible if your content is answering the queries the competition hasn’t.</p> <h3> 4. Choose what type of blog post you’re writing.</h3> <p> There are several types of blog posts you can create, and they each have different formats to follow.</p> <p> Six of the most common formats include:</p> The List-Based Post The "What Is" Post The Pillar Page Post (“Ultimate Guide”) The Newsjacking Post The Infographic Post The “How-To” Post <p> Save time and download six blog post templates for free. </p> <h3> 5. Generate a few different titles and choose the best one.</h3> <p> Your blog title should tell readers what to expect, yet it should leave them wanting to know more — confusing, right?</p> <p> This is why when you’re coming up with a blog post title that you should brainstorm multiple ones instead of just one.</p> <h3> 6. Create your outline and designate keyword-rich H2s and H3s.</h3> <p> When outlining, you need to center your main ideas with keyword-rich H2s and H3s. These are going to be your headers and subheaders that readers typically search for, and the information that Google crawls when indexing and ranking content.</p> <h3> 7. Write your blog post!</h3> <p> We already told you how to build out your outline earlier in the post, so we'll quickly go over the main points once more.</p> <p> You've already outlined your main headings and subheadings, so now's the time to add the body.</p> <p> Write about what you already know, and if necessary, conduct additional research to gather more information, examples, and data to back up your points, while providing proper attribution when incorporating external sources. When you do, always try to find accurate and compelling data to use in your post.</p> <p> This is also your opportunity to show personality in your writing. Blog posts don't have to be strictly informational, they can be filled with interesting anecdotes and even humor if it serves a purpose in expressing your ideas. It also factors into creating and maintaining your blog's brand voice .</p> <p> Don't be discouraged if you're having trouble stringing sentences together, you're not alone. Finding your "flow" can be challenging, but there are many tools to ease the process. </p> <h3> 8. Proofread your post.</h3> <p> The editing process is an important part of blogging — don't overlook it.</p> <p> Ask a grammar-conscious co-worker to copy edit and proofread your post. You may also consider enlisting the help of The Ultimate Editing Checklist or using a free grammar checker like Grammarly .</p> <p> If you're looking to brush up on your self-editing skills, turn to these helpful posts for some tips and tricks to get you started:</p> How to Become a (Better) Editor: 13 Editorial Tips How to Become a More Efficient Editor: 12 Ways to Speed Up the Editorial Process 10 Simple Edits That'll Instantly Improve Any Piece of Writing <h3> 9. Add images and other media elements to support your ideas.</h3> <p> When you're finished checking for grammar, shift your focus to adding other elements to the blog post than text. There’s much more to making a good blog post than copy, here’s some following elements to add in support of your ideas:</p> <h4> Featured Image</h4> <p> Choose a visually appealing and relevant image for your post. As social networks treat content with images more prominently, visuals are more responsible than ever for the success of your blog content.</p> <p> </p> <p> For help selecting an image for your post, read " How to Select the Perfect Image for Your Next Blog Post " and pay close attention to the section about copyright law.</p> <h4> Visual Appearance</h4> <p> No one likes an unattractive blog post. And it's not just pictures that make a post visually appealing — it's the formatting and organization of the post, too.</p> <p> In a well-formatted and visually-appealing blog post, you'll notice that header and sub-headers are used to break up large blocks of text — and those headers are styled consistently.</p> <p> Here's an example of what that looks like:</p> <p> </p> <p> Screenshots should always have a similar, defined border so they don't appear as if they're floating in space — that style should stay consistent from post to post.</p> <p> Maintaining this consistency makes your content look more professional and easier on the eyes.</p> <h4> Topics and Tags</h4> <p> Tags are specific, public-facing keywords that describe a post. They also allow readers to browse for more content in the same category on your blog. Refrain from adding a laundry list of tags to each post. Instead, put some thought into a blog tagging strategy.</p> <p> Think of tags as "topics" or "categories," and choose 10-20 tags that represent all the main topics you want to cover on your blog. Then stick to those.</p> <h3> 10. Upload your post into your CMS.</h3> <p> You filled out your blog post with all the optimized content you can, now is the time to publish it in your content management system.</p> <p> You can opt to post your content immediately, save it as a draft, or schedule when you want it to be posted live in case you adhere to a posting schedule.</p> <h3> 11. Determine a conversion path (what you want your audience to do next).</h3> <p> A conversion path is a process by which an anonymous website visitor becomes a known lead. It sounds simple enough, but creating an effective conversion path requires a clear understanding of your target audience and their needs.</p> <p> Having a conversion path is important because when you share your content on the web, you should have an idea of what your audience should do next, or in other words, provide them with a path forward.</p> <p> The HubSpot Flywheel model is a great example of this as it shows how our organization gains and maintains leads.</p> <p> </p> <h3> 12. Add calls to action to guide your audience to take action.</h3> <p> Call to action (CTA) are a part of a webpage, advertisement, or piece of content that encourages the audience to do something. You can add them to your blog post to guide your reader with “next steps” or a conversion path.</p> <p> Different types of call to actions include asking readers to:</p> Subscribe to your newsletter to see when you publish more content. Join an online community in your blog domain. Learn more about a topic with downloadable content. Try something for free or discount to convert readers to customers. <p> To get a better idea of how to make a CTA that readers want to click, we have a whole list of effective call to action examples for you to check out.</p> <h3> 13. Link to other relevant blog posts within your content.</h3> <p> When you’re completing your blog post, you should link relevant content throughout it. An effective way to do this is to link within the same content cluster.</p> <p> Keeping relevant content throughout your post can provide your readers with more helpful information, and potentially boost search engine rankings with corresponding longtail keywords .</p> <p> But we’ll talk more about how to improve your ranking in the next step.</p> <h3> 14. Optimize for on-page SEO.</h3> <p> After you finish writing, go back and optimize the on-page elements of your post.</p> <p> Don't obsess over how many keywords to include. If there are opportunities to incorporate keywords you're targeting, and it won't impact reader experience, do it. If you can make your URL shorter and more keyword-friendly, go for it. But don't cram keywords or shoot for some arbitrary keyword density — Google's smarter than that!</p> <p> Here's a little blog SEO reminder about what you should review and optimize:</p> <h4> Write your meta description.</h4> <p> Meta descriptions are the descriptions below the post's page title on Google's search results pages. They provide searchers with a short summary of the post before clicking into it. They are ideally between 150-160 characters and start with a verb, such as "Learn," "Read," or "Discover."</p> <p> While meta descriptions no longer factor into Google's keyword ranking algorithm, they give searchers a snapshot of what they'll get from reading the post and help improve your clickthrough rate from search.</p> <h4> Optimize your page title and headers.</h4> <p> Most blogging software uses your post title as your page title, which is the most important on-page SEO element at your disposal. But if you've followed our formula so far, you should already have a working title that will naturally include keywords or phrases your target audience is interested in.</p> <p> Don't over-complicate your title by trying to fit in keywords where they don't naturally belong. With that said, if there are clear opportunities to add keywords you're targeting to your post title and headers, feel free to take them. Also, try to keep your headlines short — ideally, under 65 characters — so they don't get truncated in the search engine results.</p> <h4> Consider anchor text best practices as you interlink to other pages.</h4> <p> Anchor text is the word or words that link to another page — either on your website or on another website. Carefully select which keywords you want to link to other pages on your site because search engines take that into consideration when ranking your page for certain keywords.</p> <p> It's also important to consider which pages you link to. Consider linking pages that you want to rank for a specific keyword. You could end up getting it to rank on Google's first page of results instead of its second page — and that isn’t small potatoes!</p> <h4> Write alt text for all of your images.</h4> <p> Alt text conveys the “why” of an image as it relates to the content of your blog post to Google. By adding alt text correlating to the topic clusters and keywords of the post, Google can better direct users’ searches to you.</p> <h4> Check that all images are compressed for page speed.</h4> <p> When Google crawls different websites, a page’s load speed holds weight in page ranking. Make sure the images you include throughout the page aren’t unnecessarily large to shorten the duration it takes to load.</p> <p> Use apps like Squoosh to minimize the size of your images without losing the quality.</p> <h4> Ensure that your blog post is mobile friendly.</h4> <p> More than 60% of organic visits are carried out on a mobile device. As such, having a website with a responsive design is critical. In addition to making sure your website's visitors (including your blog's visitors) have the best experience possible, optimizing for mobile will score your website some SEO points.</p> <h3> 15. Publish and promote the blog post.</h3> <p> Share your post across all the marketing channels in your repertoire. The further the reach, the more of a possibility that readers will find it.</p> <p> Channels to expand your blog post promotion strategy include:</p> Social Media Marketing : Sharing your content on the most popular social media networks like Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, etc. Email Marketing : Sharing the newest post with your email subscribers to find. Boosted Posts or Paid Ads : Allocating budget toward advertisement on search engines inorganically. Word of Mouth Marketing : Actively influencing people to read your content organically. <h3> 16. Track the performance of the blog post over time.</h3> <p> Your post is published for the world to see, make sure you’re keeping an eye on its performance over time so you can see if your blog post strategy is working well enough for your goals.</p> <p> There’s a plethora of website traffic analysis tools that you can take advantage of to better understand your audience’s behavior on your blog posts.</p> <h2> Ready to blog?</h2> <p> Blogging can help you build brand awareness, become a thought-leader and expert in your industry, attract qualified leads, and boost conversions.
